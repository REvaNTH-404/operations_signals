# Signals and Systems Application

This project is a Python application designed to explore and manipulate various types of signals in the context of signals and systems. Users can select different signal types and apply various operations to visualize the effects graphically.

## Features

- User-friendly GUI for selecting signal types and operations.
- Real-time plotting of original and processed signals.
- Extensible architecture for adding more signal types and operations in the future.
